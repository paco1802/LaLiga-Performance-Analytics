# LaLiga-Performance-Analytics
Predictive modeling and performance analysis for LaLiga using Scikit-learn and Python.
Implementation phase.
Project Goal: This project aims to build a robust predictive model to analyze team performance dynamics and forecast match outcomes in LaLiga. The focus is on applying rigorous Data Science methodology to identify non-obvious performance indicators that drive results.
Key Features & ScopeClassification Modeling: Utilizing Scikit-learn to build classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict Win/Loss/Draw outcomes.Advanced Feature Engineering: Moving beyond simple goals/shots to incorporate metrics like xG (Expected Goals), ball progression, and team momentum statistics.Data Pipeline & Organization: Following a modular pipeline for data acquisition, cleaning, and model development.Deployment Target: Development of an interactive web application (using Streamlit) for real-time visualization of predicted outcomes.
